Did you ever want to know the weather of your city without opening your browser? 

This is the solution for you.

PyWeather is a CLI application that gives you the weather of your city in a matter of seconds.

Even if you are far from the *real-window*, you can know the weather from your closest *terminal-window*.

## Installation

In order to use PyWeather, you need python3.6 or higher installed on your machine.

To install python, go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download python version 3.6 or higher.

After installing python, Clone this repository to your machine.
